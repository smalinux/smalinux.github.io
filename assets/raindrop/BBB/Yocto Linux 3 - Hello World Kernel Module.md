# Yocto Linux #3 - Hello World Kernel Module
This video goes through the process of creating a hello-world kernel module for both a PC and for the ZedBoard.  First we create the PC kernel module to ensure that it works.  Then we go through the process to create a custom Yocto layer, add a special recipe, and then build the custom kernel module for the Zynq QEMU simulator and for the ZedBoard.
