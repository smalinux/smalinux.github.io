I have cuted list of blogs & websites I want to follow.    
I want to notify and KNOW about these updates.  
I want EVERYTHING to be under control!  
I don't like to lose my track.  
So, RSS is good for keep tracking these cuted blog websites.  

RSS itself is good, but the bad thing about RSS that these is no perfect software for me.  

I want it:  
1. Free. and opensource.
2. easy to access from everywhere. (mobile and computer & sync).
3. I want to save on GitHub (my cloud) all my feed, I want to restore all my setup quickly once I explode my current laptop and buy a new one (sync again). I don't want to lose my track again, I want to know what exactly an which article read/unread.

newsboat is good but boring for me.
I use fluent-reader: https://github.com/yang991178/fluent-reader  

My (cloud) repo: [GitHub - smalinux/dotconfig-fluent-reader: /home/smalinux/.config/fluent-reader/](https://github.com/smalinux/dotconfig-fluent-reader)
